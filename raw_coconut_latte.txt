Raw Coconut Latte is a popular drink from Luckin coffee that was launched last year. 
This new product saved Luckin Coffee from the verge of brankruptcy and has become a signature summer drink
that everyone loves.
I personally would give it a 10/10 because I really love the rich coconut flavor,
and it reminds me of my last summer in Shanghai.
It's an awesome drink and I would recommend anyone who has a chance to go to China to try it out there :)
